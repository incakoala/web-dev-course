  This is the loosely modeled Amazon page for the "Pro MERN Stack" book.
  It incorporates responsive layout techniques to allow for representation of the content
  in various media displays.
  The page is divided into 3 main blocks: header, content, and description.
  Inside the content block are illustration, order info, and order form sub-blocks where the
  first and last are fixed-width, allowing for a modular layout of the product page.
  After reaching each cut point, these blocks will stack themselves appropriately.

        <p>Assemble the complete stack required to build a modern web app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. This
          book also covers many other complementary tools: React Router, GraphQL, React-Bootstrap, Babel, and Webpack.
          This new edition will use the latest version of React (React 16) and the latest React Router (React Router 4),
          which has a significantly different approach to routing compared to React Router 2 which was used in the first
          edition of the book.</p>

          <summary class="bk-link">
            Read more
          </summary>

          <p>Though the primary focus of Pro MERN Stack is to equip you with all that is required to build a
            full-fledged web application, a large portion of the book will be devoted to React 16. The popular MEAN
            (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack introduced Single Page Apps (SPAs) and front-end
            Model-View-Controller (MVC) as new and efficient paradigms.</p>

          <p>Facebook's React is a technology that competes indirectly with AngularJS. It is not a full-fledged MVC
            framework. It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (in some sense the View part). Yet, it is
            possible to build a web app by replacing AngularJS with React â€“ hence the term MERN stack</p>

          <h4>What You Will Learn</h4>

          <li>Discover the features of React 16 to get the maximum out of this library</li>
          <li>Gain the basics of MongoDB, Express, and Node to build a web app</li>
          <li>Work with other libraries complementary to React, including React-Bootstrap, React Router, and GraphQL
          </li>
          <li>Use tools such as Babel and Webpack required to build JavaScript-based SPAs</li>
          <li>Tie all the components together to build a complete web app.</li>

          <h4>Who This Book Is For</h4>

          <p>Developers and architects who have prior experience in any web app stack other than the MERN stack will
            find the book useful to learn about this modern stack. Prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is
            required.</p>
